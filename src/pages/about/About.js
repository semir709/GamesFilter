            Welcome to my project, a clone of the RAWG video game database
            website! This site was created as a personal challenge to improve my
            front-end development skills, with a focus on implementing infinite
            loading for content. I use the RAWG API to provide all the game data
            displayed here. Special thanks to RAWG for making their API
            available. Please note that this site is for educational purposes
            only and is not intended for commercial use.
